# [üîô](README.md) Documentation Search with Laravel Boost

Laravel Boost's documentation search tool provides version-specific documentation access for the Laravel ecosystem, ensuring you always get relevant information for your installed package versions.

## Documentation Search Tool

### Overview

The `search-docs` tool provides:
- **Version-specific results** based on your installed packages
- **Laravel ecosystem coverage** including Laravel, Filament, Livewire, Pest, etc.
- **Contextual search** with multiple related queries
- **Real-time package version detection**
- **Comprehensive documentation access**

### Basic Documentation Search

**General Framework Questions:**
```
Ask Claude Code: "How do I create middleware in Laravel 12?"
```

This searches Laravel 12-specific documentation for middleware creation patterns.

**Package-Specific Queries:**
```
Ask Claude Code: "How do I add file uploads to Filament resources?"
```

Searches Filament 4.x documentation for file upload implementation.

**Multi-Package Integration:**
```
Ask Claude Code: "How do I test Filament resources with Pest?"
```

Searches both Filament and Pest documentation for testing patterns.

## Advanced Search Strategies

### 1. Multiple Query Approach

For complex topics, use multiple related queries:
```
# Ask Claude Code with multiple angles:
"How do I implement user roles and permissions in Laravel with Filament?"

# This might search for:
# - "laravel authorization roles permissions"
# - "filament user management policies"
# - "spatie permission package laravel"
```

### 2. Package-Specific Searches

Focus on specific packages when needed:
```
# Ask Claude Code:
"Show me Livewire 3 component patterns for forms"
"How do I customize Tailwind CSS in Filament 4?"
"What are the new features in Laravel 12?"
```

### 3. Version-Aware Development

Always get current version information:
```
# Ask Claude Code:
"What's new in the Laravel framework version I'm using?"
"Show me Filament 4 migration guide from version 3"
"How has Pest changed in the latest version?"
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Pre-Implementation Research

Before building features, search for best practices:
```
# Ask Claude Code:
"How should I structure a blog application with Filament 4?"

```

### 2. Problem-Solving Workflow

When encountering issues:
```
# Ask Claude Code:
"How do I fix Laravel validation errors in Filament forms?"

## Documentation Search Tips

### 1. Be Specific

### 3. Version Awareness

Trust that Boost will find version-specific information:
- The tool automatically uses your installed package versions
- Results are filtered for compatibility with your setup
- No need to specify versions unless comparing different versions

### 4. Multiple Perspectives

Ask related questions for comprehensive understanding:
```
# Ask Claude Code:
"How do I implement user authentication in Filament?"
# Follow up with:
"How do I customize the Filament login page?"
